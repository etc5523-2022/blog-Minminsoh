Here, we are showing the 10 states with highest percentage of population who met the guidelines by Male and Female. The results vary slightly compared to the ranking shown in ?@tbl-avgwork . We can observe that among Male, District of Columbia is the most active state, fllowed by Vermont, Idaho and Colorado. As compared to Female, New Hampshire and Colorado share the highest percentage, follow by Utah, Idaho and Washington. However in general, male is generally more active compared to female.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Top 10 States in the United States with the highest percentage of male population who met the physical activity guidelines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Top 10 States in the United States with the highest percentage of female population who met the physical activity guidelines"
