    "text": "Keeping active is essential for maintaining physical health and weight. Despite the benefits of being physically active, physical inactivity is identified as the fourth leading risk factor for death globally. Major implications include a rise of health conditions, such as stroke, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to CDC (2022), the US obesity prevalence has increased from 30.5% to 41.9% from 2000 to 2020. Obesity also leads to a significant medical costs in the United States, where the estimated annual medical costs was around $173 billion in 2019."

This is the similar issue recognised worldwide, where women are less active than men across most countries. Gender gap in physical activity is mainly due to concerns about stereotypes, sociocultural norms and attitudes towards physical activity since childhood. Cla (2018) found that girls during teenage years tend to experience less confidence and less enjoyment from sports as compared to boys, which then shape their attitudes to physical activity into adulthood. Apart from that, there are less investments in women and girls’ sports, including access to transport, coaching and access to equipment facilities. In adulthood, apart from managing work, women still play a significant role in childcare and managing household, which then lead to less available time to work out."

    "text": "Geographic Differences? - What about exercise rate in each state in US?\nAs observed in Figure 3 and Figure 4, the percentage of adults reaching the national exercise target varies between states. As mentioned before, the average national level is 22.52% , which represents the percentage of adults reaching the national physical activity guideline. Figure 3 shows which states are above the national average, below the national average or around the national average. Figure 4 then shows the disparity of the percentage of adults reaching the national target level in each state.\nCounties in the central such as Colorado and Utah as well as along the west coasts such as California are much more active where there are higher percentage of adults having more exercise than the national average as observed in Figure 3. Among which, Colorado is the most active state as shown in Figure 4, around 32% of adults meeting the national physical activity guidelines. David Bassett, co-director of the University of Tennessee’s Obesity Research Center points out that Colorado is one of the wealthy regions in the country, and the temperate climate as well as access to trails encourage people to pursue outdoor activities (Suddath (2009)).\nIn contrast, Figure 3 shows that most of the states in the southeast are below than the national average, such as Kentucky, Mississippi, West Virginia and South Carolina. We can also observe that Mississippi being the least active state in Figure 4 where only 13% of adults reaching the national target.\nThese were discussed in Suddath (2009), where the South’s weather is hot and humid, therefore discouraging people from doing physical activities during summer, unlike the healthier states such as California. The lack of public transportation and access to sidewalks in the region also contribute to the problem, as for most people, the best way to commute is by car. These have also led to a high percentage of health issues such as heart disease and hypertension among the population in that region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: This figure shows the percentage of adults in each state who met the Physical Activity Guidelines. The percentage in each state is compared to the National Average 22 percent, and is categorised into 3 groups, namely Above Average, Average and Below Average. Counties in the central such as Colorado and Utah as well as along the west coasts such as California are much more active. In contrast, most of the states in the southeast are below than the national average, such as Kentucky, Mississippi, West Virginia and South Carolina.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: This figure shows the percentage of adults in each state who met the Physical Activity Guidelines. Colorado is the most active state compared to the other states in the United States. The least active state is Mississippi."
